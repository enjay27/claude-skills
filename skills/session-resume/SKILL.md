name: session-resume
description: Start a session in one of Kade's repositories by reconstructing where the work stands - read the state (STATUS.md on the status branch, labelled issues, or MEMORY.md), open and recently merged PRs, and the current branch, then summarize and propose the next task. Use when Kade opens a session with "resume", "continue", "where were we", or pastes a starter prompt from a handoff.

# Session resume

Goal: in one short reply, Kade sees where things stand and what you propose to do next.
Do not edit anything until he confirms (kade-workflow, plan first).

## 1. Read the state

The repository's `CLAUDE.md` says which source it uses (its *Current state* line):

1. **Org Project repositories** (Stella Rain: the `status` branch of `app`; Resonance: the `status` branch
   of `star-resonance/resonance-stream`): the snapshot.
   ```bash
   git fetch origin status && git show origin/status:STATUS.md
   ```
   Check its *Generated* time. If it is older than the work needs, run the snapshot workflow
   (`project-snapshot.yml`, `workflow_dispatch`, a repository-scoped call), wait for it, and read again.
2. **`MEMORY.md` repositories**: `MEMORY.md` (often already loaded through `CLAUDE.md`).
   If its *Now* names a handoff or session file, read that one file, not the whole folder.

If Kade pasted a starter prompt from `session-handoff`, it names the branch, PR and next step:
trust it, then confirm against the sources above.

## 2. Read the recent work

- Open PRs from `claude/*` branches: their status and CI result.
- The last 3 to 5 merged PRs: read their *NOT VERIFIED* and *Wrong turns* sections.
- `git status` and the current branch. Uncommitted changes are Kade's unless the starter
  prompt says they are a parked task.

## 3. Know the machine

Find out which machine this session runs on (Windows, macOS, or the NAS over SSH). Checks labelled
`cmd:verify-needs-<machine>` for another machine are not for this session: list them as waiting.

## 4. Report (at most about 15 lines)

- **Where things stand**: one or two lines.
- **Now**: the items in progress.
- **Machine**: name it in one line.
- **Waiting on Kade** first (decisions assigned to him), then **Needs <this machine>** (this session can run
  them), then **Needs <other machine>** (say which machine they wait for), then anything unproven.
- **Proposed next task**: one task, with the gate it needs and whether this session can run it; never a
  check that needs another machine.

Then ask him to confirm or redirect.
